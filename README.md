# My-HR

## What is My HR?
Built for Mine Eclipse, My HR is a system for collecting, viewing, discussing and managing applications.

This application consists of two (mostly) independent websites: one for application collection and the other for viewing, discussing and managing them.
My HR includes features like Notes for collaboration and discussions, Feedback from the main website, user management, proposals, Desktop and more!

## Feature description
My HR is first and foremost a tool for collecting applications so they are the central component of My HR experience. You can filter applications by team,
search them by keywords or even open them in Desktop, a tool offering an interface similar to desktop operating systems with support for multiple draggable windows.
Other important features are proposals and Notes. The idea of proposals is that a given number of people have to agree on a decision for an application to be accepted
or rejected. To support this, Notes are the place to chat and discuss applications with other My HR users. 

Currently My HR has a manually created user website but a form builder is on the way so you could easily build forms to fit your needs!
