					You are getting access to sensitive user data. Because of that, every user of
					My HR Console is required to use Two-Factor Authentication in addition to their password.
					You will need to install an authenticator app on your smartphone and enter a one-time password
					generated by the app every time you log in.
					We recommend using Authy, Google Authenticator or Microsoft authenticator.
