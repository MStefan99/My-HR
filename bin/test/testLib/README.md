# Test libraries

**WARNING: Libraries in this folder are not supposed to be used in development!**
Test libraries are designed to be used in testing only, often to clean up any artifacts generated by test setups
or test cases themselves, and many public methods ignore user permissions completely!
Using these libraries in development can not only pose a security risk but also corrupt and/or delete 
sensitive user data!

For development libraries, please check /bin/lib/ directory.
